# Nonograms

What is nonograms?
According to puzzle-nonograms.com: Nonograms is a logic puzzle with simple rules and challenging solutions.The rules are simple. You have a grid of squares, which must be either filled in black or marked with X. Beside each row of the grid are listed the lengths of the runs of black squares on that row. Above each column are listed the lengths of the runs of black squares in that column. Your aim is to find all black squares.

My nonograms works as follows:
Left click to shade squares, right click to eliminate them. If you'd like to change a shaded square back to normal, left click again, and right click an eliminated square to turn it back to normal as well. Once you've shaded all cells in the correct positions, a dialogue box will pop up saying congratulations, and you've solved the puzzle!
This nonograms game is expandable, and you can add as many puzzles of as many sizes as you'd like. The algorithm for checking if the solution is correct will work with any new puzzle you might add to the puzzle library. https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com/ has a library containing millions of puzzles, so finding additional ones or just completely making up new ones to add should be easy!
